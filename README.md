# Music Genre Classification using ANN and CNN

This repository contains code examples for music genre classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Introduction

Music genre classification is a common problem in the field of audio signal processing and machine learning. The goal is to develop models that can automatically classify songs into different genres such as rock, pop, jazz, etc.

In this repository, we provide two code examples to showcase how music genre classification can be achieved using ANN and CNN.
